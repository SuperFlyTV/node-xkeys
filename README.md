node-xkeys
==========

A node.js package for reading and controlling an PI Engineering XKeys HID devices. The package is still under development.  Currently only supports connecting and setting the LEDs and Backlights.

This package works best on linux.  It seems that the mac version of libusb seems to have some issues and it only works from time
to time.
